# buffer-overflow

## What is buffer overflow?

A __buffer overflow__ is when user input to a program, while writing data to a __buffer__, causes the unintentional overwriting of adjacent memory. This can be exploited, termed a __buffer overflow attack__.

## The Stack

The __stack__ is an example of a FIFO data structure, with two operations: _push_ (adding to the top) and _pop_ (removing from the top). In many operating systems, each program has its own stack, and each stack is used to store local variables and return addresses of functions in that program.
